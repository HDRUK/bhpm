# DEMOS AND TESTS FOR bhpm
This directory contains demonstration analyses and test results for the bhpm package. 
The tests cover all the main use cases of the software and exercise the available functionality.
These may be run on Linux or Windows.

There are 2 main interfaces to the package functionality:
- bhpm.pm
- bhpm.npm

### Demonstrations Analyses
===========================
Demonstration analyses for the main functionality are in the ./demo directory:
- bhpm.pm - ./demo/demo_bhpm.pm.r
- bhpm.npm - ./demo/demo_bhpm.npm.r

Each analysis follows the same set of steps:
--------------------------------------------
1. Load the data (file or data frame).
2. Call the model fitting function (bhpm.pm/bhpm.nmp).
3. Check convergence. (bhpm.convergence.diag/bhpm.print.convergence.summary).
4. If required - produce summary statisics (bhpm.summary.stats/bhpm.print.summary.stats).
5. Assess which adverse events are associated with treatment (bhpm.ptheta).


### Test
========
The test data for the methods are in correspondingly named directories:
- bhpm.pm
- bhpm.npm
Within each of these directories are subdirectories containing variations on the tests (parameter changes etc).

As the Bayesian methods rely on sampling there is a degree of variation in the model outputs.
Consequently the tests for the Bayesian methods consist of two parts:
- Correctly predict which AEs are associated with treatment for a data set for which these outcomes are known.
- Match the results of the previous release of the software for a given random seed. This should happen unless the order
of sampling within the code has been changed.

Tests:
======
1. ./bhpm.npm - test bhpm.nmp and related functions (conv, summary, ptheta):
			./default_parameters - run with default parameters
			./changed_parameters  - change individual simulation parameters
			./initial_values - run model with user supplied initial values
			./single_chain  - runs a single chain model fit wih default parameters
2. ./bhpm.pm - test bhpm.pm and related functions (conv, summary, ptheta):
			./changed_pm_weights - change the weighting for the point-mass mixture
			./changed_sim_params  - change individual simulation parameters
			./single_chain  - runs a single chain model fit wih default parameters
			./default_parameters - run with default parameters
			./initial_values - run model with user supplied initial values


Within each of these tests subdirectories the following exists:
baseline: directory containing the files:
	conv.dat - convergence statistics from the previous software release
	summary.dat - summary statistics from the previous software release
	ptheta.dat - theta posterior probabilities from the previous software release
	ptheta95.dat / ptheta80.dat - theta posterior probabilities exceeding 0.95 / 0.80

test: test directory where output files are created.
	run.r - script to run the test. The tests can be run by hand by running this script in R.

run.sh/run.bat: Run the tests.

check_test.sh/check_test.bat: check the test results

cleanup.sh/cleanup.bat: remove generated files

Example (Linux):
================

cd bhpm.pm
cd changed_sim_params/

This test to show the effect that sampling parameters may have on model convergence and
how they may be addressed.
